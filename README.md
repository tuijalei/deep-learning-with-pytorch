# PyTorch Beginner - deep learning with PyTorch

This repository contains the code and notes from the course 'PyTorch Beginner' organized by Python Engineer. The course is about all the necessary basics to get started with the PyTorch deep learning framework.

The course has been divided into 17 parts (NB! Some of the parts have been compined in the repository since they are using the same code as the base):

1. Installation - How to install PyTorch and Anaconda
2. Tensor Basics -  Basics of Tensors and Tensor operations in PyTorch
3. Autograd - Calculating gradients using the autograp package in PyTorch
4. Backpropagation - Necessary concepts about backpropagation algorithm explained and used in a concrete example
5. Gradient Descent - How to use autograd engine in practice: coding a linear regression model from the scratch and manually computing prediction, loss function and weight updates
6. Training Pipeline - Improving the code from the last part and learning how a complete training pipeline is implemented in PyTorch
7. Linear Regression - Implementing a linear regression model and applying training pipeline into practice
8. Logistic Regression - Implementing a logistic regression model and applying training pipeline into practice
9. Dataset and Dataloader - How to use the built-in Dataset and DataLoader classes and imrpove pipeline with batch trainin
10. Dataset Transforms - How to use dataset transforms together with the built-in Dataset class
11. Softmax and Crossentropy - Learning the softmax function and the cross entropy loss function, the math behind the functions and how to use them in PyTorch
12. Activation Functions - What are activation functions, why are they needed, and how do we apply them in PyTorch.
13. Feed Forward Net - Implementing the first multilayer neural network that can do digit classification based on the MNIST dataset
14. CNN - Implementing the first convolutional neural network that can do image classification based on the CIFAR-10 dataset
15. Transfer Learning - How transfer learning can be implemented in PyTorch
16. Tensorboard - How to use Tensorboard to visualize and analyze the models
17.  Save & Load Models - How to save and load the model with different functions in different ways and what to consider when using a GPU
